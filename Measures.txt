A. Core Operational Metrics

1. Total Admissions
Total Admissions = COUNTROWS(Admissions)

2. Total Surgeries
Total Surgeries = COUNTROWS(Surgeries)

3. Average Length of Stay (LOS)
Avg LOS = AVERAGE(Admissions[LengthOfStay])

4. Readmission Rate (%)
Readmission Rate (%) =
DIVIDE(
    CALCULATE(COUNTROWS(Admissions), Admissions[ReadmissionFlag] = 1),
    [Total Admissions]
) * 100

5. Admission Outcome Breakdown
Recovered Admissions = CALCULATE(COUNTROWS(Admissions), Admissions[Outcome] = "Recovered")
Deceased Admissions = CALCULATE(COUNTROWS(Admissions), Admissions[Outcome] = "Deceased")
Transferred Admissions = CALCULATE(COUNTROWS(Admissions), Admissions[Outcome] = "Transferred")

B. Staff & Resource Utilization Metrics

1. Total Staff
Total Staff = COUNTROWS(Staff)

2. Active Staff
Active Staff = CALCULATE(COUNTROWS(Staff), Staff[Status] = "Active")

3. Average Experience (Years)
Avg Experience = AVERAGE(Staff[ExperienceYears])

4. Average Salary
Avg Salary = AVERAGE(Staff[Salary])

5. Staff Utilization (%)
Avg Staff Utilization (%) = AVERAGE(ResourceUtilizationSnapshots[StaffUtilizationRate]) * 100

C. Bed & Equipment Utilization

1. Average Bed Occupancy (%)
Avg Bed Occupancy (%) = AVERAGE(ResourceUtilizationSnapshots[BedOccupancyRate]) * 100

2. Average Equipment Utilization (%)
Avg Equipment Utilization (%) = AVERAGE(ResourceUtilizationSnapshots[EquipmentUtilizationRate]) * 100

3. Average ER Wait Time (Minutes)
Avg ER Wait (Minutes) = AVERAGE(ResourceUtilizationSnapshots[ERWaitTimeMinutes])

D. Surgery Performance Metrics

1. Average Surgery Duration (Minutes)
Avg Surgery Duration (Minutes) = AVERAGE(Surgeries[DurationMinutes])

2. Complication Count
Complication Count = CALCULATE(COUNTROWS(Surgeries), Surgeries[ComplicationFlag] = 1)

3. Complication Rate (%)
Complication Rate (%) =
DIVIDE(
    [Complication Count],
    [Total Surgeries]
) * 100

E. Financial KPIs

1. Total Revenue (Billed Amount)
Total Revenue = SUM(Financials[BilledAmount])

2. Total Cost
Total Cost = SUM(Financials[TotalCost])

3. Avg Profit Margin (%)
Avg Profit Margin (%) = AVERAGE(Financials[ProfitMargin]) * 100

4. Avg Insurance Coverage (%)
Avg Insurance Coverage (%) = AVERAGE(Financials[InsuranceCoveragePct]) * 100

5. Net Profit
Net Profit = [Total Revenue] - [Total Cost]

F. Regional / Hospital-Level Rollups

Admissions per Hospital
Admissions per Hospital =
DIVIDE(
    [Total Admissions],
    DISTINCTCOUNT(Hospitals[HospitalID])
)

2. Surgeries per Hospital
Surgeries per Hospital =
DIVIDE(
    [Total Surgeries],
    DISTINCTCOUNT(Hospitals[HospitalID])
)

3. Avg Beds per Hospital
Avg Beds per Hospital = AVERAGE(Hospitals[NumBeds])

G. Composite Efficiency Score (Optional for Power KPI Visual)

Efficiency Index
Efficiency Index =
([Avg Bed Occupancy (%)] * 0.3) +
([Avg Staff Utilization (%)] * 0.3) +
((100 - [Avg ER Wait (Minutes)] / 60 * 100) * 0.2) +
([Avg Profit Margin (%)] * 0.2)
